# Scala-TicTacToe

This is the final project for the 2018/19 edition of the
[MSc. in Software Craftsmanship](https://www.etsisi.upm.es/master-upm-software-craftsmanship)
from [Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid](http://www.upm.es/).

## Description

This project consists in the design and implementation of a middle-sized application: the
[Klondike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_(solitaire)) game. The application will
be CLI-based, and will be implemented using the functional paradigm and with the
[Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) programming language.

## Goals

### Main Goals

* Explore the functional paradigm by implementing a known application
* Evaluate the differences between functional and imperative programming when using
   design patterns.

### Stretch goals

* If there is enough time, a continuous integration (CI) system will be used to develop the
  project, using free online services, such as [GitHub](https://github.com/) and
  [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/).
